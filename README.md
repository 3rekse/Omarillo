## Turtle Logo Extension Overview

![Turtle Logo Blocks](./assets/Turtle_Logo_Blocks_0.3.0.png "Turtle Logo Blocks")

This MakeCode Arcade Extension adds "Turtle Logo" programming language to make code.
This code uses a previous version ([https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-screen-turtle](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-screen-turtle)) but I needed some specific changes as requested by the elementray teacher I was working with:
- needed to minimize the number of blocks
- needed to have multiple "turtles" on the screen at same time
- needed to use cartesian coordinates, this (0,0) being in the center of the screen
